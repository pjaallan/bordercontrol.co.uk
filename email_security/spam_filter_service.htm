			Microsoft Exchange Hosted Filtering Service. We can implement an 
			outsourced email spam and anti virus filter security solution no 
			matter how large or small your business to stop spam, viruses, phishing scams,
			worms and denial of service reaching your computers.</p>
			
			<h3>Hosted Email Filtering Concept</h3>
			
			<p>Your company email is diverted to Microsoft&#39;s Frontbridge email spam and virus filter for analysis, where it is scanned
			 for viruses, spam, fraudulent scams (phishing), worms and all email risks. Once the email is checked, it is forwarded as normal to your existing
			 email system free of spam and viruses. There are no changes at all to your existing setup, making this extremely easy to implement.</p>
			 
			<p>This spam blocking service offers total protection against spam, viruses, phising scams and all other junk e-mail.</p>

			<p>Microsoft Exchange Hosted Filtering email security 
			spam and anti virus filter is completely managed for 
			you, there&#39;s no technical setup, and there is no hardware to install
			and no equipment to purchase at all. With just a simple mail exchange
			(MX) record change, e-mail will be routed to Microsoft Exchange Hosted Filtering.</p>			
			
			
			
			<p>Exchange Hosted Email Filtering can be used in conjunction with any e-mail
			server or e-mail client. We can implement POP3 collection or direct 
			SMTP feed to your server. Don’t worry if you don’t know what MX records are, we
			can hand hold during this and speak to your IT people to make sure the
			change over is painless. You are not expected to have any technical
			knowledge and a helping hand is only an email or call away.</p>
			<p>Spam email is removed to a secure area where it can be reviewed and forwarded if necessary to the
			 intended recipient. Viruses are blocked and deleted.</p>
			<p>In addition, the service provides tools for writing rules to help enforce
			corporate and regulatory policies governing e-mail usage and disaster
			recovery tools to queue mail for delivery in the event of an e-mail
			server outage.</p>
